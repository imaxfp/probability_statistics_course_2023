# neural_n00b
#### Neural Network from the scratch implementation.

#### The main idea of the NN is education purpose. 


TODO1 Max: Google Colab or Binder (for hosting notebooks)

- add different activation functions and derivatives 
- add visualisation for the NN
- visualisation and add 3 lists (LOSS, Acuracy for validation dataset and test dataset) matplotlib or streamlit. 
- support additional layers 
- autoencoder 'set param true and get 'mirror' NN -> 784/100/10 - 10/100/784' 'what NN has seen'
